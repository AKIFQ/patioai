# Task 5.2 Completion Summary

## Task: Clean up unused imports and dependencies (CONSERVATIVE CLEANUP)

### ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

## Unused Imports Removed
1. ✅ `getOrCreateSessionId` from `app/room/[shareCode]/components/RoomChat.tsx` - Not used after Socket.IO migration

## Verification Process
1. ✅ **Multiple search methods used**: grep, file search, manual inspection
2. ✅ **Conservative approach**: Only removed clearly unused imports
3. ✅ **Comprehensive analysis**: Checked all files affected by realtime cleanup
4. ✅ **Dependency verification**: Confirmed all Supabase dependencies are still needed for database operations

## Analysis Results

### ✅ Legitimate Imports (Kept)
- **Supabase client imports**: All used for database operations (not old realtime)
- **React hooks**: All useEffect, useCallback, useRef imports are being used
- **SWR imports**: All mutate and useSWR imports are being used
- **Router imports**: All useRouter imports are being used
- **Socket.IO imports**: All new Socket.IO related imports are being used

### ✅ Dependencies Analysis
- **@supabase/ssr**: ✅ Still needed for server-side operations
- **@supabase/supabase-js**: ✅ Still needed for database operations
- **No realtime-specific dependencies found**: ✅ Clean

### ✅ Console.log Statements
- **Debugging statements**: Kept essential Socket.IO debugging logs
- **No old realtime debug code found**: ✅ Clean

### ✅ Environment Variables
- **No realtime-specific env vars found**: ✅ Clean

### ✅ Type Imports
- **No unused Supabase realtime types found**: ✅ Clean

## Impact
- ✅ **Cleaner code**: Removed 1 unused import
- ✅ **No functionality lost**: All necessary imports preserved
- ✅ **Conservative approach**: Only removed clearly unused code
- ✅ **No breaking changes**: All functionality intact

## Next Steps
- Task 5.3: Implement frontend performance optimizations
- Continue with remaining cleanup tasks

## Conclusion
The codebase is remarkably clean after the Socket.IO migration. Most imports are legitimate and necessary for the current functionality. The conservative approach ensured no breaking changes while removing the minimal unused code found.
