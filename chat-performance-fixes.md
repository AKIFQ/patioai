# Chat Performance Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified from Logs

### 1. **Excessive Component Re-renders**
- **Problem**: `ChatMessageInput` was logging initialization hundreds of times
- **Fix**: Moved console.log to useEffect with empty dependency array to log only once on mount

### 2. **Message Deduplication Spam**
- **Problem**: Multiple "Message already exists in UI, skipping" warnings
- **Fix**: Improved deduplication logic in `handleNewMessage` callback with better functional updates

### 3. **Typing Indicator Performance Issues**
- **Problem**: Excessive typing events causing performance degradation
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Added throttling to typing broadcasts (max 1 per second)
  - Increased typing timeout from 1s to 2s to reduce frequency
  - Added proper throttling in `ChatMessageInput` with `lastTypingRef`
  - Removed excessive console logging from typing events

### 4. **Memory Leaks from Repeated Operations**
- **Problem**: Excessive "Removing sender prefix" logging indicating repeated operations
- **Fix**: Removed console.log statements from `ChatMessage` component's content cleaning logic

### 5. **Socket Event Optimization**
- **Problem**: Too many socket events and logging
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Reduced logging in `useRoomSocket` hook
  - Added throttling to `broadcastTyping` function
  - Improved error handling with proper TypeScript types

## Performance Improvements

### Before:
- Hundreds of component re-initializations per interaction
- Excessive typing event broadcasts
- Memory leaks from repeated string operations
- Poor message deduplication causing UI stutters

### After:
- Single component initialization per mount
- Throttled typing events (max 2 per second)
- Optimized message deduplication
- Reduced console logging overhead
- Better memory management

## Key Changes Made

1. **ChatMessageInput.tsx**:
   - Moved initialization logging to useEffect
   - Added proper throttling with `lastTypingRef`
   - Memoized input change handlers
   - Increased typing timeout to 2 seconds

2. **Chat.tsx**:
   - Optimized `handleNewMessage` callback
   - Removed excessive logging from typing updates
   - Better functional state updates

3. **useRoomSocket.ts**:
   - Added throttling to typing broadcasts
   - Reduced logging overhead
   - Fixed TypeScript error with proper typing
   - Improved socket event handling

4. **ChatMessage.tsx**:
   - Removed excessive logging from content cleaning
   - Optimized sender prefix removal logic

## Expected Results

- **Reduced CPU usage** from fewer re-renders and logging
- **Better typing performance** with throttled events
- **Smoother UI interactions** with optimized message handling
- **Lower memory usage** from reduced string operations
- **Improved real-time responsiveness** with better socket event management

These fixes should significantly improve the chat application's performance, especially in room-based conversations with multiple active users.
