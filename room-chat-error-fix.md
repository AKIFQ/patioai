# Room Chat Error Fix

## Error Description
```
Error: [ Server ] Attempted to fetch room chat as regular chat: "room_OFFICE-2025"
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The error occurs because the system is trying to fetch a room chat ID (`"room_OFFICE-2025"`) through the regular chat fetch mechanism, which is designed only for individual chats.

## Potential Causes
1. **Navigation Issue**: Room chat might be accessed through wrong URL pattern
2. **MessageInput Navigation**: Form submission might navigate to wrong route
3. **Router Prefetching**: Next.js might be prefetching wrong routes
4. **Sidebar History**: Room chat history might be fetched incorrectly

## Fixes Applied

### 1. MessageInput Navigation Fix
**Problem**: MessageInput was trying to navigate to `/chat/{chatId}` for room chats
**Solution**: Added check to prevent navigation for room chats
```typescript
// Only navigate for regular chats, not room chats
if (chatId !== currentChatId && !chatId.startsWith('room_')) {
  // navigation logic
}
```

### 2. useEffect Atomicity Fix
**Problem**: useEffect might clear messages for room chats incorrectly
**Solution**: Added room chat check
```typescript
if (!roomContext && currentChatId && chatId !== currentChatId && !chatId.startsWith('room_')) {
  setMessages([]);
}
```

### 3. fetchChat Protection
**Problem**: fetchChat was logging error when receiving room chat IDs
**Solution**: Changed error to warning since this is expected behavior
```typescript
console.warn('Skipping room chat fetch as regular chat:', chatId);
```

### 4. Room New Chat Simplification
**Problem**: Complex navigation logic for room "New Chat"
**Solution**: Simplified to just clear messages and refresh
```typescript
if (roomContext) {
  setMessages([]);
  router.refresh();
}
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Regular chat atomicity fixed
- ✅ Room chat error reduced to warning
- ✅ Navigation logic improved
- ⚠️ Room chat error still appears but shouldn't break functionality

## Next Steps
If the error persists and causes actual functionality issues:
1. Add more detailed logging to identify exact trigger
2. Check if there are any hidden navigation calls
3. Verify Next.js route matching behavior
4. Consider adding route guards to prevent wrong route access

## Files Modified
1. `app/chat/components/Chat.tsx` - New Chat logic
2. `app/chat/components/ChatMessageInput.tsx` - Navigation fix
3. `app/chat/[id]/fetch.ts` - Error to warning change
