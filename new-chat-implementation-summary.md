# New Chat Button Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added a "New Chat" button to the chat interface that works differently for regular chats vs room chats.

## Features Implemented

### 1. New Chat Button Location
- Added to the chat header (top of the chat interface)
- Visible in both regular chats and room chats
- Includes loading state with spinner

### 2. Regular Chat Functionality (`/chat` or `/chat/{id}`)
**Behavior:**
- Creates a new UUID for the chat session
- Navigates to `/chat/{new-uuid}`
- Previous chat is automatically saved to history
- Sidebar chat history is refreshed
- UI shows a clean slate for new conversation

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const newChatId = uuidv4();
router.push(`/chat/${newChatId}`);
await mutate((key) => Array.isArray(key) && key[0] === 'chatPreviews');
```

### 3. Room Chat Functionality (`/chat/room/{shareCode}`)
**Behavior:**
- Clears the current local view
- Refreshes the same room (stays in room context)
- Maintains room participants and context
- Room messages are shared, so this just refreshes the view

**Implementation:**
```typescript
setMessages([]);
const newUrl = `/chat/room/${shareCode}?displayName=${displayName}&sessionId=${sessionId}&refresh=${Date.now()}`;
router.replace(newUrl);
```

## UI Components

### Button Design
- Outline style button with "New Chat" text
- Plus icon (or loading spinner when active)
- Positioned in the top-right of the chat header
- Disabled state during navigation

### Header Layout
```
[Room/Chat Title]                    [Participants Info] [New Chat Button]
```

## Files Modified

### `app/chat/components/Chat.tsx`
- Added New Chat button to header
- Implemented `handleNewChat()` function
- Added loading state management
- Added proper imports (uuid, Loader2 icon)

## How It Works

### For Regular Chats:
1. User clicks "New Chat"
2. Current conversation remains in database (auto-saved)
3. New UUID is generated
4. User is navigated to new chat page
5. Previous chat appears in sidebar history
6. New chat shows empty state

### For Room Chats:
1. User clicks "New Chat" 
2. Local message state is cleared
3. Page refreshes with timestamp parameter
4. User stays in same room with same participants
5. Fresh view of current room messages
6. Room messages are persistent and shared

## Benefits
- Consistent UX across both chat types
- Proper chat history preservation
- Clear visual feedback with loading states
- Maintains room context for group chats
- Easy access to start fresh conversations
